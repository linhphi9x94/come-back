     * Issue summary
       To support for 2.4G band only model requirement
     * Analysis / Root cause
       In order to support 2.4G band, it needs to block 5G band setting.
     * Solution
       In order to enable this feature, it needs to define CONFIG_WLAN_5GDISABLE in kernel config

 - Added to define DHD_DISABLE_VHTMODE
     * Issue summary
       To support for 802.11ac disable model requirement
     * Analysis / Root cause

     * Solution
       In order to enable this feature, it needs to define CONFIG_WLAN_VHTDISABLE in kernel config

DHD 1.77.56 - 2017.11.30
Major Issue
 - CS3928981 Fixed to allocate 64KB for WLAN_DHD_WLFC_BUF_SIZE on 32bit platform also
     * Issue summary
       A8/43455/NOS, couldn't operate screen mirroring over WFD only under the VSDB/MCC       
     * Analysis / Root cause
       For a smooth VSDB/TX operation, PROP_TXSTATUS(WLFC) feature is being used
       However, not enough pre-allocated memory for WLFC was allocated on 32bit platform
       So VSDB/TX regression issue happened due to low pre-allocated memory size (16KB)        
     * Solution
       For WLFC_BUF_SIZE, pre-allocates 64KB for 32bit platform also

 - CS4011220 Block ADPS enable private command at RF test mode
     * Issue summary
       Have a trouble to measure RF performance at RF test mode by ADPS
     * Analysis / Root cause
       During RF test mode, PM 0 is set to disable WiFi dongle PM operation including ADPS,
       but “ADPS enable“ private command was called after setting PM 0 so ADPS was run again
       This issue happened after enabling ADPS by default
     * Solution
       Block “ADPS enable” private command when PM 0 is set for RF test mode

 - CS4034777 Enabled ARGOS notification callback for DHD TCP ACK suppress
     * Issue summary
       Low TPUT issue occurred in TCP long RTT environment
     * Analysis / Root cause
       The reason is that DHD TCP ACK suppress was always enabled because ARGOS feature was removed in DHD
     * Solution
       Turn off DHD TCP ACK suppress by default and enable ARGOS notification callback to control DHD TCP ACK suppress by current TPUT

 - Configure 64bit DMA mask for MSM8998 (Default enabled: it can be controlled by the SET_DMA_MASK_64BIT  definition in the Makefile)
     * Issue summary
       Kernel allocated the memory in swiotlb region for DMA mapping since the default DMA mask is set to 32bit
     * Analysis / Root cause
       It's configured to 64bit mask for DMA mapping to check if  kernel allocates the memory for DMA mapping to different region and TPUT is improved
     * Solution
       Based on the kernel DMA mapping guidance, DHD configure DMA mask to 64bit
